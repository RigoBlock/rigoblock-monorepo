# Introduction

The RigoBlock API is a programming interface written in TypeScript to interact with the [RigoBlock Protocol](https://github.com/RigoBlock/rigoblock-monorepo/tree/master/packages/contracts) solidity smart contracts.

It is automatically generated from the JSON ABI files of the compiled solidity contracts. The contract ABIs are extracted from our contracts package and saved to a temporary directory. We then use 0x's library [abi-gen](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/master/packages/abi-gen), in conjunction with our custom template written in [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to map over the ABI methods and create the TypeScript files. The template can easily be modified to allows us to add extra methods if needed.

Using the API a user can create and manage decentralized token pools, as well as purchase shares of said pools and many other features that come from the various contracts.
